# COVID-19 Animated Map Visualization

This project provides an animated visualization of global COVID-19 case data using Python. The data is sourced from the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University, and the visualization is created using Folium to display the temporal progression of confirmed cases across countries.

## Overview

The project fetches COVID-19 confirmed case data, processes it, and generates an interactive, time-based map using Folium. The map displays confirmed cases as circles whose sizes and colors vary based on the number of cases. The map is animated to show the progression of the pandemic over time.

## Features

- **Data Downloading**: Automatically retrieves the latest COVID-19 data from the official GitHub repository.
- **Data Processing**: Transforms raw data into a format suitable for visualization.
- **Map Visualization**: Uses Folium to create an interactive map with circles representing confirmed cases.
- **Animation**: The map animates over time to show the spread of the virus.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `requests`, `pandas`, `folium`, `numpy`
